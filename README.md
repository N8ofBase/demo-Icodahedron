# Icosahedron
## Intro
An Icosahedron is a twenty sided polygon with equalateral triangle faces, most commonly reffered to by us as a twenty sided die or D20. 
In another universe it is a whole world of twenty unique environments wherein the actions and destiny of all living things are determined by the roll 
of their own personal internal icosahedron. A **"20"** results in great rewards, exhaulting victories, and bountiful harvests; whilst rolling a **"1"** ensures 
suffering, famine, and death... <br>
<br>
Plane 20 of Icosahedron is home to the Crit Castle, currently being corrupted by a foul being known as **Feyl**. Feyl and it's minions are spreading a plague of 
"1's" across the planes of Icosahedron, increasing the amount of sorrow and death to all flora and fauna. The Tryang is the lowest of these planes and is home to a 
small village on the brink of destitution, desperate for a savior. Will you venture into The Icosahedron and restore balance to the life of this world? <br><br>
